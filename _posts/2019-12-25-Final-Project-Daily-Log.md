Title: Final Project Daily Log
---

Below is a log of my daily progress, including:

1.) What I worked on today

2.) What I learned

3.) Any road blocks or questions that I need to get answered

4.) What my goals are for tomorrow

**January 7th**
Today Ethan and I researched various methods of reading in music to a Jutyper notebook. After much trial and error and learning that many programs were out of date, we finally managed to download some installers, but as we were about to test them the fire alarm went. However, we did learn that programs exist that will read in a music file and break it down into several components, allowing us to edit it and analyze it. We will need to work on streamlining the read in process. My goal for tomorrow is to effectively read in and analyze a song, and possibly begin to analyze more components of the song.

**January 8th**
Today Ethan and I worked on importing our first piece of music and converting it into a workable format. We researched all of the various plugins that we would need in order to actually import and manipulate the files. Usually what would happen is we would import a plugin, think it was what we needed, and then realize in the subsequent error message that we needed to download another one. We installed home-brew in our computers and then used that to install more packages. The culmination of all of this installation was that we were able to read in the mp3 file of Uproar by Lil Wayne, and then convert it into a .wav file so that we could later analyze the file. Then, when we attempted to begin analyzing the file, we ran into more plugin issues, and learned that we would have to manually find the proper location for the latest plugin to go. We are currently still attempting to figure out where the plugin should go within the vast file network of anaconda. We have learned today how many different aspects of python requires plugins and that if we are going off the beaten track at all, to factor in a lot of time. Tomorrow we hope to fix our issues with the latest plugin and actually begin analyzing the song that we have.

**January 9th**
Today Ethan and I, with much help from Lauren, finally managed to get all the plugins in the right place and learn what was going wrong. Following that, we managed to get what code we had working, and managed to generate a weird sort of graph. Now, we can focus on importing more plugins to vamp and using them to analyze our song. Tomorrow, we hope to move forward in our analysis and get a good amount of data for our song, then start looking for more songs in a usable format.
