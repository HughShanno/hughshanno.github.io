**January 7th**
Today Ethan and I researched various methods of reading in music to a Jutyper notebook. After much trial and error and learning that many programs were out of date, we finally managed to download some installers, but as we were about to test them the fire alarm went. However, we did learn that programs exist that will read in a music file and break it down into several components, allowing us to edit it and analyze it. We will need to work on streamlining the read in process. My goal for tomorrow is to effectively read in and analyze a song, and possibly begin to analyze more components of the song.
